# Splitwise to Toshl

This is a command line application that will take your expenses in splitwise and automatically input them into toshl.

## Development

You need to have python 3 installed

## Usage

This also only runs on your personal accounts. You need to get the API keys from both these services and input them into your `config.cfg` file. There is an example config file provided.

To get the splitwise API key, go [here](https://secure.splitwise.com/apps):
To get the toshl API key, go [here](https://developer.toshl.com/):

Run this command after you have set up the config files.

```sh
python main.py
```

To use the program, key in the number or letter in the `[]` brackets and press Enter.

All other necessary instructions should be in the program itself.

This is roughly how the program works.

```
