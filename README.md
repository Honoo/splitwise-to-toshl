# Splitwise to Toshl

This is a webapp that will take your expenses in splitwise and automatically input them into toshl.

Originally this was a command line application, but since python 3.12, something broke and I decided to rewrite it in a more modern way.

This is an outdated version of the app, the updated link is here:
